# List of 10 projects

# 1. HOPS 2.0 Algorithm, which assigns separate predictive scores to players for winning attacking and defending headers.

# 2. xG Algorithm, which assigns a predictive score to the likelihood of a goal being scored based on the setup of the scoring opportunity.

# 3. PSxG Algorithm, which assigns a predictive score to the likelihood of a goal being scored based on the quality of the shot on target and the goalkeeper's attempt to save the shot on target.

# 4. xPass Algorithm, which assigns a predictive score for how many passes a player should have connected, based on the passes that they attempted.

# 5. xReceive Algorithm, which assigns a predictive score for how many passes a player should have received, based on the passes that they received.

# 6. xPoints Algorithm, which assigns a predictive score for many points a team should have earned based on their performance in a game.

# 7. xThreat Algorithm, which assigns a predictive score of how threatening a ball movement action is in a game.

# 8. xCrossing Algorithm, which assigns a predictive sore for how likely a cross is to connect in a game.

# 9. 18-Yard Box Entry Optimization, which simulates the optimal methods of entering into the opponent's 18-yard box.

# 10. Aggregate Pattern Play Detector, which uses machine learning to detect the common successful and threatening ball movement patterns of a team.
